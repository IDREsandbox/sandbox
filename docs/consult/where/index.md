<p tabindex="0">Our office is in what’s known as the Sandbox. Getting there can be a challenge.</p>

<p tabindex="0">The Sandbox is in the Math Sciences building (room 4328). There are two doors marked as 4328. Be sure to go to the red, not white, double door. Please knock loudly!</p>

<p tabindex="0">Here are two options for arriving at our office:</p>

<ol>
    <li tabindex="0">You can access the 4th floor of the Math & Sciences building from two ground-level entrances on the north side of the building. The closest entrance faces the Engineering V building (this route is visualized in the video above). The other faces Kerckhoff and Moore Halls. Enter either entrance, turn right, and follow the hall in a counter clockwise direction until you see our big red double-door labeled Sandbox.</li>
    <li tabindex="0">Go to ground level of the east end of the Math Sciences building (you’ll see a row of vending machines and this takes you into the building on the 5th floor), walk towards its west end (near Rm5308) and then take either the elevator or stairs one floor down. Turn left and you should see our big red double-door labeled Sandbox.</li>
</ol>
