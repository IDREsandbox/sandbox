## Utilizing GPS Data

After collecting data from the field, where do go from there?

Bringing GPS to life requires taking the data and putting it into some platforms, whether it be desktop-based or web-based.

This section of the workshop will provide some examples of working with GPS data.

\[TBS\_ALERT color="danger" heading="Note!"\] You don't really need to take notes, as you can find some tutorials on these topics on the following page: [http://sandbox.idre.ucla.edu/?page\_id=1420](http://sandbox.idre.ucla.edu/?page_id=1420) \[/TBS\_ALERT\]

# Topic 1 - Retrieving the GPS data

# Topic 2 - Cleaning up the data

For Windows users, [GPS Track Editor](http://www.gpstrackeditor.com/) is a great and free application for extracting different GPS data. For Mac and Linux users the opensource [JGPS Track Edit](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jgpstrackedit/) works well too.

# Topic 3 - GPS data Analysis

[QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/) allows you to run spatial analysis on your GPS data such as:

- Hotspot analysis
- Data interpolation

# Topic 4 - Sharing GPS data online

[GeoJSON.io](http://geojson.io/) allows you to work with your GPX data points by simply dragging and dropping your points into the window. You can add tables and edit your data too. Finally, the power of GeoJSON.io is being able to save your data into different formats and share your data with others online.[![geojson_io](images/geojson_io-1024x166.png)](http://sandbox.idre.ucla.edu/sandbox/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/geojson_io.png)

[Doarama](http://doarama.com/) is a online web application in beta that allows you to sync your GPS data tracks to footage on YouTube.
