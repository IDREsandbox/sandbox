Welcome to the Advanced Practical Python for Automation and Data Visualization workshop, also referred to as the APP workshop:

#### [https://sandbox.idre.ucla.edu/sandbox/](https://sandbox.idre.ucla.edu/sandbox/)

Why the APP workshop? Because we will be making APPlications! These four to be exact:

1. File Organizer
2. Dict2CSV Maker
3. Data Visualization
4. Sentiment Shakespearean Analysis

Without much further ado for nothing, let's get started by clicking on the first APP script below:

1. [Getting warmed up: working within operating systems](https://sandbox.idre.ucla.edu/sandbox/advanced-practical-python-1)
2. [Writing out a CSV file](https://sandbox.idre.ucla.edu/sandbox/advanced-practical-python-2)
3. [Charting the Seas with Seaborn](https://sandbox.idre.ucla.edu/sandbox/advanced-practical-python-3)
