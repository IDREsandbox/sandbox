## Welcome to the cartodb-workshop page!

We will be using [Live notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OsEta8QOMyP7T75WH_PV0HBqDtYCK8qj_U9BB-swFpc/) for the class. Feel free to share thoughts, ideas, and notes here with us and your fellow workshop attendees.

This workshop is intended as a hands on introduction to using CartoDB for mapping and spatial research. It is broken up into several parts and you can use the navigation pages to the right to go to any part of the workshop. We have included bonus sections on Palladio, a tool we like for visualizing and better understanding your data, and on storytelling using CartoDB's OdysseyJS platform.
