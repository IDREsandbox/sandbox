In an increasingly interdisciplinary academic environment, there are certain technologies that are situated at the crossroads of collaborative research methods.  Digital mapping is one such technology that crosses many disciplines, as inquiries on locational data are becoming integral to the methods of analysis.

UCLA’s Institute for Digital Research and Education ([https://idre.ucla.edu/](https://idre.ucla.edu/)) and the UCLA Library ([http://www.library.ucla.edu](http://www.library.ucla.edu)) are co-sponsoring these three-part workshop series on mapping. RSVPs are required, but these sessions are free and open to all members of the campus community. The series will cover a overview of historical maps, digital mapping, and UCLA resources supporting GIS; lightening talks with current researchers and maps; methods in visualization using CartoDB and Palladio. Our focus will be on discussing spatial technologies, as well as some technical discussion on approaches for research projects.
