- University licensing makes it affordable, and it comes with technical support
- "Complete" solution, from desktop based spatial analysis to web deployment
- Huge community of users in academia, government, and private industry
- no competitor comes close to provided the wide scope of spatial analysis

 | 

- user interface
- template driven
- little emphasis on design
- tough learning curve
- affordable while in school only
- it doesn't play well with other mapping technologies

 |
| Google |
