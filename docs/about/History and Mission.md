## History
Closely associated with the Institute for Digital Research and Education (IDRE), the current incarnation of the Technology Sandbox has been supporting digital research needs of faculty and staff by providing a space and staff support for creative innovation since 2006. In those early years, the focus was on interactive computer modeling and historic reconstructions. In the summer of 2006, the facility hosted Sander Goldberg’s NEH-funded summer institute on “Models of Ancient Rome” that featured the Rome Reborn project, developed by PIs Diane Favro and Bernard Frischer. Other notable project of that time include Digital Karnak (PI Willeke Wendrich and Diane Favro) and the a reconstruction of the Romanesque Cathedral of the Santiago de Compostella by John Dagenais
