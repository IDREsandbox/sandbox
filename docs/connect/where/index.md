The Sandbox is located in a labyrinth-like path. Here are the steps to get there:

1. Start at the main entrance of the building.
2. Take a right turn at the first corridor.
3. Walk straight until you reach a staircase.
4. Go up the staircase to the second floor.
5. Take a left turn and walk straight until you see a door marked 'Sandbox'.

Please note that the path may seem complicated at first, but once you've found it, it's quite straightforward. Happy exploring!
