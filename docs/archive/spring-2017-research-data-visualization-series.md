The annual spring digital research workshop series is now in its third year since it was first introduced. These workshops are intended for beginners, with no prior skillsets required. The workshops will be more instructional than hands-on, so attendees are not required to have access to a laptop.

UCLA’s Institute for Digital Research and Education ([https://idre.ucla.edu/](https://idre.ucla.edu/)) and the UCLA Library ([http://www.library.ucla.edu](http://www.library.ucla.edu)) are co-sponsoring these three-part workshop series on mapping. RSVPs are required, but these sessions are free and open to all members of the campus community.
