Do you care about climate change? Do you want to make a difference?

Do you want to help people affected by recent natural disasters, environmental impacts, and other humanitarian issues? What about the chance to show a little Bruin Pride and exercise your global citizenship? Come to our humanitarian mapa-thon event - No GIS skills are required – and we will quickly train you to use Open Street Map to assist in humanitarian projects around the world.

Last year’s event was one of the largest on Earth - we made over 10,000 edits to humanitarian projects in just three hours – but we can do better!

The focus this year is on how climate change is impacting our lived environment. Join us to learn more about how you can make a difference through mapping!
