# Research and Pedagogy in 3D

This hands-on intermediate workshop, developed for the 2016 American Historical Association Annual Meeting, will explore the array of new tools and technologies for integrating 3D content into research and pedagogy. Following a brief overview of the field, participants will engage with a variety of 3D projects, with examples ranging from augmented reality to on-line virtual worlds. VSim, a new NEH-funded prototype software interface for real-time exploration of academically generated 3D models, will also be featured. VSim allows users three modes of navigation, includes a mechanism for creating linear narratives through the virtual world that can be augmented by text and images (think PowerPoint or Prezi in 3D space), and provides a mechanism to link to primary and secondary resources from within the modeled environment. The session will conclude with a discussion about research and pedagogical applications for 3D technology.
