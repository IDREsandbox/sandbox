**Yoh:** I hope we can speak in an open dialog.

**Hitomi:** Yes! We didn't really discuss about that beforehand about anything.

**Yoh:** Yes, and I think I like that... so no pressure on me and no pressure on you, hopefully. I want to tell you what I know about you. So before Noel to me about your film screening a week ago I didn't know anything about you.

**Hitomi:** Really?

**Yoh:** I had no idea who this person was. She sent me this \[flyer\], and I was like, oh wow, how come I've never seen this before. So I did a lot of internet research.

**Hitomi:** Ahhh, yeah...

**Yoh:** So now I know a lot about you.

**Hitomi:** Good and bad.

**Yoh:** mostly good. I didn't see anything bad.

**Hitomi:** Really?

**Yoh:** Yes, because I am a big fan of women like you.

**Hitomi:** Thank you (laughs)

**Yoh:** So, I want to start with a quote. On the internet I watched several of your interviews. I saw the one with Ian of the Japan Times.

**Hitomi:** Oh, Ian Ash Thomas!

**Yoh:** And several other interviews as well. I want to talk a little bit, since I haven't seen your films.

**Hitomi:** Any of my films?

**Yoh:** I saw all the previews, three movies, four movies now.

**Hitomi:** Now this is the fifth, all about nuclear issue.

**Yoh:** Yes, and you know, I started my research in Fukushima right after 3.11 so I am very excited to meet you. But putting that aside, I wanted to ask you, and this is based on a quote, I think it was with Ian's interview, where you say, "I'm very good at breaking Japanese men's pride"

**Hitomi:** Did I say so? (laughs)

**Yoh:** I think you mention something like that. I really liked that because it is symbolic of who you are as a person, but also when I saw an hour of that interview, I am really interested in finding out about you as a person because I find your story extaordinary, and I think you are a good role model for all women in Japan. Coming from someone like me–I am Japanese, but I have only lived part of my life in Japan–I feel that you embody all the wonderful qualities of the Japanese woman, and at the same time, you also have all the qualities that are a-typical of the same Japanese woman, so I want to get to the essence of that character

**Hitomi:** That is your point of view?

Hitomi’s Mother \[3:25\]

**Yoh:** Based on what I only saw on the Internet, yes. So maybe if we start, could you tell me a little bit about where you are from, where you grew up, and a little bit about your childhood?

**Hitomi:** I am grown up in rural area, prefecture is Toyama, and small village. I was a village girl. And then my parents, half farmer and half working at office. And my mother is a house keeping wife, I have an older brother. But I was a little bit different from other children when I was small. I couldn't agree with many, many things. And I was curious about many things and questioning and questioning everything. But adults always told me, that you “just follow”, that is the right way to do as woman, or as girl, as child.

**Yoh:** What were some things that as a child you questioned?

**Hitomi:** For example, I really wanted to join festival, the traditional festival, every spring and every autumn. In my village, they have a traditional festival, and they have a dance and drums. I wanted to do drumming, “wadaiko” and then “tengu dance”, and tengu killing, “shishi” lion, very traditional form of, but it is ordinary, everywhere in Japan, they have the same kind of traditional dance. So I really wanted to be a drummer, but everybody says that it is not a task for girl. You shouldn’t touch it. WHY? (laughs)

**Yoh:** So they wouldn’t even allow you to participate?

**Hitomi:** No. I tried, and then my parents, especially my mother, was so angry, “it is so shame you doing that!"

**Yoh:** So your mother sided on the Japanese traditional side?

**Hitomi:** Very, very much.

**Yoh:** She wanted you to behave more like a traditional Japanese girl?

**Hitomi:** Traditional Japanese girl, so her purpose, her goal, was for my daughter became very good bride, “hanayome” (花嫁). Oh, such a good bride (laughs). So her great mother is this kind of person. She really wanted from the bottom of her heart. So that is how she trained me strictly.

**Yoh:** To become a bride?

**Hitomi:** Wife, a good wife, house keeping wife. And from a small age, she trained me like a housekeeping, cleaning, cooking and many many things.

**Yoh:** And this is very typical in Japanese families?

**Hitomi:** But that was a little bit too much. So my classmates visited my home, and then I told them that, oh, wait a little bit, I need to do my tasks. And then they were wondering, oh your mother is not your real mother? I was shocked! What? you don’t do the same things at your home? No, no no. (laughs)

**Yoh:** And what was your relationship with your father? He was a part time farmer?

**Hitomi:** Father was… my mother was more powerful than my father because in Japan, girl enters husbands house, but my mothers case was opposite. My mother was only one child, so that is why, my father came in. So, kind of, she wanted to be a bride, but she couldn’t. That is how, she really, kind of, expected me to be like… so when I was growing up, I have to fight with my mother, what I really want to do when I really want to do, always. So she is against it, opposed to it, so then I need to fight with my mother.

**Yoh:** I see, I am starting to see the beginnings of the film maker.

**Hitomi:** Yeah, every time she called me “oyafukomono” (親不孝者)

**Yoh:** Someone who betrays your parents wishes? Those are very harsh words.

**Hitomi:** It really hurt me. She wanted to control me, as like a… she was thinking that, oh Hitomi belongs to me, I can manipulate, I can control as her mother, so this is my right to do this kind of way of thinking.

**Yoh:** And I would guess she did not treat your brother the same way?

**Hitomi:** Opposite, yeah (laughs). It was so, kind of contrast was so clear, so I was always wondering “why”, why you do this? and then my mother answered, “oh, because he is boy, and you are girl. That is why” (laughs)

**Yoh:** I noticed in the interviews that I have seen of you, that you love the word “why”. You want to question, would you say that is accurate?

**Hitomi:** Yes, “why” or “how”.

The Film Maker \[11:35\]

**Yoh:** If we could kind of think forward a little bit. What were some defining life moments for you. We were talking about if you miss an opportunity, you may never get it again. What were some opportunities that you took charge of, what were som moments in your life that had an impact on who you are today?

**Hitomi:** I am a film maker. I decided when I was in my last grade of college, because, so my mother refused to help me to go to college. So the reason was, marriage timing going to be late (laughs). Wow! So then, I thought it was a good opportunity, I should be independent, financially, so I said, “ok”, I do everything by myself. And she was so angry.

**Yoh:** She is losing control.

**Hitomi:** Yeah, insane, almost. I managed, I was paying for university, and also my everyday life, so both I had to do. So I also interested in explorer, anthropological things, so I became a member of explorer club, “tankenbu”. It started in Japan since… have you ever heard of Imanishi Kinji? He was a beginner of researching monkey, “sarugaku”, how human beings became from… So he started this explorer club at Kyoto University and then started in many other universities and colleges. At Waseda, it was one of the oldest ones. Then I became a member and I started visiting Southeast Asia. Other members were doing, for example, traveling by bicycle from Southern most part of South America and riding bicycle to Alaska or something. Somebody was doing canoeing Yukon, from the beginning to the end. So then I planned to do my own exploration by motorbike tour from Indonesia. Indonesia has 250 islands so I was planning to visit all islands. It is like a necklace. So I was going to meet different cultures and different people and I was wondering, how to tell them, tell other people I met this kind of people, I encountered this kind of happenings, so I was wondering, maybe I take photo, and then I write a report. Then, at that time, I had a boyfriend, and he was making film. Drama. Also in the university school group. I was planning, preparing to go, getting sponsor to give me motorcycle, kawasaki at that time, so step by step, I was kind of preparing, then suddenly, my mother sensed, “oh she is doing something”, and then she became ill. So, I had to go back to hometown, and I had to take care of her. But immediately she became ok (laughs), so I lost chance, she wanted to break it. Disturbing (laughs). But I came back to campus, and then my boyfriend said, “ok, you have time now, so you can help me”. So I started helping my boyfriend’s filmmaking. I didn’t have the idea that I could make films. But when I helped him, Oh, it’s possible, I can do it. Even, I’m better than him. So why not? So I started having kind of revenge on my missed exploration. So then I decided, immediately I decided, ok, I am going to be a film maker. So simple! (laughs)

**Yoh:** From an incredible missed opportunity in Indonesia, to a revenge story to become a film maker. That is amazing.

**Hitomi:** So my purpose, my goal… I want to make a film, my first film should be in Indonesia. Kind of road movie.

**Yoh:** So you went back?

**Hitomi:** Eventually I did it. But at that time, now, this kind of video camera we have, it is so easy and small and compact. But at that time, 16mm film, and equipment is too heavy, and not so mobilizable, I did not know, so I decided to not study film at school, I just self study, and also, I started working as assistant director, and I learned from people. I thought it is a waste of time and money to go to school. I just wanted to study directly from film makers. so then I did it, but I visited many film production companies, but at that time, not so many women film maker directors, so all of them said, “oh we don’t need woman”, “we don’t need girl”.

**Yoh:** This is the same story from childhood!

**Hitomi:** Again! Denied again!

20:58

**Yoh:** How did you break that barrier?

**Hitomi:** When I was a university student, I told you I often visited Southeast Asia. Then I got many people who supported Asian people in many ways, in Japan. “Oh, Kama wants to be a film maker”, and then one of them who was working for Tokyo Language University, she wanted to bring Indian film into Japan. It’s a new wave of Indian film. She wanted to put sub-title, and wanted screening in Japan. So she asked me, if you would like to help this project, I am going to introduce a guy who runs film production, so I said “yes, yes, please”, so then I met this guy, Shuichi Koizumi. So then I said something, I was telling other production, and he says, “Ok, you can try”. That’s how I met him.

**Yoh:** It took one person to believe in you. And you being different from everybody else, he saw something in you.

**Hitomi:** So since then, he started giving me a chances, opportunities. And he just passed away last November. We worked together more than 30 years. That’s how I started film making.

Nuclear Issues \[23:35\]

**Yoh:** So I want to ask you, why nuclear issues, nuclear power? For me, there are many scholars interested in what happened in Fukushima. Since you are way before that time, what was your motivation to focus on this topic?

**Hitomi:** So… I was interested in human beings, people, individual people, then I didn’t interested in single issue before, but somehow I feels that mass media not treat field exist, so I was interested this kind of field, like a taboo or difficult issue to treat. But like beforehand, I started making film of nuclear issues, I was in New York, then, I worked with media activist called “Paper Tigers”, and when Gulf War happened, they were making program that many many citizen groups in the US were against the Gulf War. But nothing on mass media. So they filmed it, and they were showing it. I didn’t know at that time, when I arrived in New York, it was 1993 and I told about this history, and I started interested in Iraq. When I go back to Japan, I started making TV program at NHK and I met a woman on the street. She was handing out papers, it says that in Iraq, children, incidents of Leukemia is increasing, but on the other hand, lack of medicine. So they are suffering.

**Yoh:** So she was an Iraqi woman?

**Hitomi:** No, Japanese woman. She started visiting Iraq just after the Gulf War ended, alone, she was bringing aid to Iraq. So then I wondered, is it real? So I should go, I thought, I felt. But no information at that time, economic sanctions was on Iraq, and not so many information coming out from Iraq, even it was difficult to get a map of Baghdad. Internet wasn’t so popular at that time, it was just starting. So to get information, you need to go there. So I told NHK producers, so, how about making program in Iraq. Oh, it’s difficult, you can do it? Yeah, I think I can do it. Ok, then they gave me budget. I started constantly making TV programs for NHK. It was kind of successful. Then they trust relationship was already built. So that’s how, maybe you can do, we know you can make good program. Then I could go. NHK producer and Shuichi Koizumi, joint production. That is how I went to Iraq. Then I met children, who had various kinds of cancer and also leukemia. All of them were very small, under 10 years old. I met a girl whose name was Rasha (?), and we became friends. We talked about many things, because I had a very good translator, and she said, “don’t forget me”. She wrote me, on a small paper in Arabic, “my dearest Kama, don’t forget me”. At that time I thought, I don’t forget you, even after I go back to Japan, I don’t forget you, I promise. But immediately after, she passed away. So not only Rasha, many children were losing their lives, because no medicine, no chemical medicine, the economic sanctions stopped, prohibited for other countries to export chemo-therapy drugs to Iraq, and also new information, medical information. Then I had to decide, should I film those children who are dying? Isn’t it crucial? So I thought, if I don’t do it, then people don’t know. So I told mother’s who are really suffering, they were feeling, oh, I can’t do anything, kind of feeling, helpless. So then I told them, I’d like to film them, then maybe Japanese people would get notice, and they would help you. I expect that Japanese don’t know what is going on in Iraq, and I’d like to tell them, show them what is going on. Then maybe things are going to change. Those mothers were, yes, so helpless, but they want to have anything to help. Then I also went to the battlefields of Gulf War and then I found depleted uranium. I measured, and it was high radiation. So, I combined my footages and then I edited and I showed it to NHK producers, and they said, “oh, this is so anti-America…”. What? What does that mean? Oh, you don’t know? American government is saying the depleted uranium has no harm to human beings. What? But those producers are highly educated, and also on top of the public media, producers, and they says so. But I promised Iraqi mothers that I am going to show this issue in Japan so I had to fight with them. We discussed, and then they gave me a condition: if I explain how American government describes depleted uranium, then you can air this program.

**Yoh:** Did you do that?

**Hitomi:** Yeah, I did it. That’s the reason I don’t know why, 6 million Japanese people watched this program, but no reaction. Not even, nobody called, and I was so disappointed about TV media. Then, next I thought, I do medical aid to Iraqi children. How should I do this? I consulted with many doctors, and citizen activists, then I met old doctor who came from Hiroshima. He is an atomic bomb survivor. Dr. Hida Shuntaro, told me that Iraqi are the same as atomic bomb survivors. Internally they were exposed by radiation. So the mechanism of this radiation exposure, internal, and outer one, and I didn’t know, I was shocked, shocked at what I didn’t know on what is going on, the real facts. My understanding was superficial. So that is how I had to make it again.

**Yoh:** That is a very powerful beginning for you to be interested this issue. That is really profound. I can see how the combination of these events defined what you call the “trilogy” the beginnings of your film career.

**Hitomi:** But at that time, nobody was interested in Iraq and depleted uranium, and Hiroshima and Nagasaki was over. But Shuichi Koizumi, I asked him, I want to stop making TV program. I want to make this as an independent film, so if you make NHK TV program, you get budget. But if I make independent film, I need to get budget from somewhere. But I asked Koizumi, producer, and he said immediately, you should do it. What? (laughs) Why do you think so? He told me, “you have been making TV program at NHK, then your creativity is ruined”. Really? you think so? I was thinking the same thing. But I didn’t tell anything to him because I thought this is a good opportunity to keep making something. Otherwise, making film takes time. You need so much budget. But he said that you should do, otherwise you can’t be a real film maker. You have to make a film of what you really want to make, from the beginning to the end. Not asking from somebody, or be limited by you should be finish to this length, or to have some kind of deadline. No, be 100% free, so that it is your own. You should do, good chance.

**Yoh:** So this is another one of these defining moments in your life…

**Hitomi:** But how about money? So he brought out a calculation machine, and told me that he will prepare this much money. And then we started discussing fund raising. So this film has no figure. It’s a blank paper, so then lets ask people, we are going to make film about Iraq, United States and Japan, people are living on contaminated land, and we travel and visiting them, listening them, and then this kind of film, if you’d like to support, so you pay film lending fee, $250… So then, the Iraq War started. No, no… 9/11 happened. Then immediately, people started to be interested in this film project, and slowly, eventually, 250 citizen groups paid it. So that’s how I got the funding.

911 and 311 \[40:50\]

**Yoh:** I often try to find some kind of a connection between 9/11 and 3/11, because in our societies, me being Japanese now living in the US, I feel there are a lot of parallels, but it’s hard to dictate what those parallels are because one is an act of terrorism and war, and the other is a natural disaster, followed by a man made disaster. But I feel that you, through your work, have this connection between 9/11 and 3/11.

**Hitomi:** Yeah, for the first time I realize, you are right! (laughs)

**Yoh:** Your work connects the two in a very interesting way.

**Hitomi:** So I grew up in Japan, and I love reading books, and also cartoons. Tezuka Osamu. I grew up, while I was a child, I was a child of Tezuka Osamu, and even when I was a teenager, I was reading “Hino Tori”, Fire Bird. Fire bird flew away from earth, and then turned back and looked back on Earth. Human Beings were using atomic bomb every where. Nuclear war was happening on Earth and it was the end of the world. It was kind of a beautiful fragment. This kind of image, the end of the world image, of my childhood. Because atomic bomb, or nuclear weapons were kind of, threatened human beings, these kinds of images were everywhere. But when I visited Iraq, and then I met Dr. Hida, I really understood. Human beings are not ending like that. So slowly, quietly, our DNA cutted by… day by day… harmed by nuclear pollution. So I realized that nuclear pollution is all over, everywhere in the world. When Rasha was dying, I imagined that Rasha is going away and she was losing sensation. She never looked at blue skies and she never, possible to feel heat, or touches of her mother. So the world is not ending, but her world, her individual world is ending like this. So that is why I put the sub-title, “hibakusha at the end of the world”. Life, when it goes away, life, at the same time the world is coming to an end. Not the world itself, but one life. She could live longer, and she wanted, but she couldn’t. Why? How? Who? Are making it, doing it \[this way\]. If I don’t understand who, or why, I thought I couldn’t change it. That is why I really need to find out in my film, and share with people… as much as many people… then something is going to be changed.

**Yoh:** So… I wanted to also ask you about… I think in the movie “hibakusha”, the farmers, I think you worked with farmers there, they mentioned how this discrepancy between what the government tells them is happening and what they are experiencing themselves. I found that statement to be having many parallels to what is happening in Fukushima. I myself have interviewed many Fukushima farmers, and they said the exact same thing, that in your movie, prior to Fukushima, the farmers were saying the same thing.

**Hitomi:** It was 2002...

**Yoh:** So I’m wondering, what do you think the general sentiment, of the people that are affected by the Fukushima nuclear crisis, what do you think the sentiment is towards the Japanese government?

**Hitomi:** So, this is very complicated. It is very difficult to explain. Foreign journalists are always complaining to me that it is too complicated, complex. So you say, nuclear power plants exploded, and then so much radiation polluted your land. But the level is OK. it is not harmful. It is polluted slightly, but not so much. You can relax about it. Then, people receive this information from government, and specialists. You have no knowledge about radiation beforehand. Then psychologically, people were kind of ok, should I accept this or not? If you say “no”, you lose, they make this kind of system. You lose your land by yourself, you deny your land. Or your loved community. No no no! This is polluted, this is dangerous, this has risk! Then, automatically you lose your property, everything. So that is why government says, “it’s ok, and you should accept it”. It’s a “high” technique, dark. So then 共犯, they are working together, but government, they don’t lose even if they don’t need to give out compensation. But farmers, they don’t lose their farm, but pollution stays. It is not fair. They know, that is why they feel anger, and feelings of betrayal accumulate. So this kind of complex makes them, like, depression, powerless, helpless, suffering.

**Yoh:** You know, I’ve been to Iitatemura (飯舘村). Beautiful place. I met with an agricultural community group and attended their meetings, and they were very defiant. To me, I felt a lot of energy and defiance against the Japanese government, but also to say "we are here, we are going to work together as a community, we are going to build, rebuild our brand."

**Hitomi:** So they are already made before 3/11. So branding was successful at that time.

**Yoh:** And also, on that same trip, I met a different farmer in Minamisoma (南相馬), who said his land is inside the evacuation zone. So he has to live outside, but he told me that he goes back, because in the day time he can go back. He goes back during the day and does agriculture. He is not allowed to, but he says this is my life. I am going to go back to my land, and make produce. He knows that he cannot sell it, but it is his livelihood. So he continues to farm, and I found that very powerful.

**Hitomi:** Yeah… so, because radiation exposure is coming later on, there is a time lag. So four years, almost, nearly five years, then looking at Chernobyl, looking at what happened, after five years, you could see health problems. So they \[famers\] are doing it because they don’t know what is going to happen to them. So its a kind of chronicle, low level radiation exposure, every day, every day, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit. But it counts. The results come ten years later, or twenty years later. So it’s a choice. People choose that it doesn’t matter, I do what I like to do, and nothing is happening on my body, so it might be ok. Even if you get cancer and leukemia or other diseases, no evidence. It is hard to prove. That is why government and TEPCO an say, “oh, it has no relationship”. That is why, you have to look at Belarus and Chernobyl, what I do in my film, what has happened already, 29 years has already passed. After five years, ten years, fifteen years, what happens to them? It’s a time slip, circular, 25 years of time lag (difference) \[with Japan\].

**Yoh:** It’s a full generation, 25 years...

**Hitomi:** Answer is already there \[in Chernobyl\].

**Yoh:** Do you have any final words? Since you are in the US, do you have anything to tell an American audience, an academic audience about your work.

**Hitomi:** Unconscious “hibakusha”. So many in the U.S. You don’t know you are exposed by radiation, or you are being… ongoing. Because in the U.S. they are producing depleted uranium missiles… still, so if you use it as a soldier, you are also exposed. And they are doing testing, at site. And then contamination is also spreading out, and also at Hanford, I filmed “Hibakusha”, they couldn’t control the contaminated liquid spreading into the Columbia River. Everywhere in the United States, contaminated land, compared to Fukushima… Fukushima is new and heavy, but in the U.S. you can find many many many contaminated area. If you notice it, the Fukushima problem/issue is the same as your issue.

**Yoh:** That is a very strong message! Thank you so much.

**Hitomi:** You are very welcome.
